Spotify's various clients all have an issue with automatic refresh. Can't seem to find a workaround yet. There aren't many features of the script, it was made specifically for me and as a joke and way to get familiar with Javascript. TODO is in the code, so is the playlist used in the demo, although you cannot edit it because it is collaborative and belongs to me.

## Requirements
- vscode Live Server plugin (Alt+L, Alt+O to start)
- Client ID
- Client secret
